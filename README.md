#  A single-window mac app written in SwiftUI

The question sometimes comes up: How can you effectively create a mac app in SwiftUI that only has one window, like some of the apps that come with macOS.

SwiftUI by default gives you a multi-window app.

I wrote a little blog post about this [here](https://www.optionalmap.com/posts/swiftui_single_window_app/).

Or you can just have a look at the file SwiftUI_Mac_Single_Window_AppApp.swift
